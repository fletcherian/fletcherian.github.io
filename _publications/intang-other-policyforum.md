title: "The Curse of Intangibility: Why Prevention Policies Fail"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/intang-other-policyforum
excerpt: 'Prevention policies systematically fail because their greatest successes are invisible: avoided disasters, prevented diseases, and non-events that cannot be attributed to the policies that caused them. This paper argues that this "intangibility" problem is distinct from other behavioral biases and requires institutional reforms that reward policymakers for outcomes no one can see.'

This paper introduces "intangibility" as a distinct behavioral phenomenon that explains chronic underinvestment in prevention policies across domains, including wildfire management, vaccination, and climate mitigation. The authors argue that outcomes are intangible when they cannot be directly observed, cannot be distinguished from noise, or cannot be attributed to specific causes—a problem fundamentally different from well-studied biases like time discounting, ambiguity aversion, or probability neglect. Using examples from the 2025 Los Angeles fires and declining vaccination rates, they demonstrate how prevention policies face an asymmetric accountability structure: success produces invisible non-events that generate no political credit, while failure remains highly visible and generates blame. The paper proposes a two-dimensional framework characterizing intangibility along observability and attributability axes, predicting that policies in the high-intangibility corner (prevention, maintenance, long-term investments) will face systematic underinvestment regardless of their cost-effectiveness. The authors call for experimental research to understand intangibility's behavioral underpinnings and suggest structural reforms—including dedicated prevention budgets and long-term accountability metrics—to offset this bias.
