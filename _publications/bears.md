Large predators are returning to landscapes where they were not seen for centuries, but human preferences challenge traditional conservation approaches. Communities often resist predator recovery due to perceived risks that influence public tolerance of predators, creating a "social carrying capacity" more restrictive than biological goals. Wildlife managers currently lack practical methods to incorporate social science into management decisions,  leaving concepts like "social carrying capacity" largely academic. We address this issue by measuring individual tolerance for risks associated with grizzly bears and comparing it to existing federal guidelines. Our results show people overestimate managementâ€™s tolerance and are more tolerant of encounters than current guidelines allow. We predict spatially specific preferences across U.S. zip codes and measure the misalignment between public preferences and management guidelines. Our approach offers a pragmatic tool for assessing predator reintroduction and recovery sites, modernizing predator management through predictive mapping, and anticipating human-wildlife conflict intensity and costs.
