Overall Quality: 3.91/5

Selected Reviews:
> Ian did a great job teaching this course, a standout quality of his was the relationships he formed with his students, he is very understanding and has a great willingness to work with people.

> I enjoyed how interactive this course was. I also enjoyed that it felt less pressured and like the professor actually wanted us to learn and feel confident with the material instead of making us feel bad about not knowing it, and really took his time making sure we understood the content.

> Ian did absolutely amazing in building 1 on 1 relationships with students as well as helping them whenever they needed it, I have not seen that sort of connection and relation building out of many professors here at UW because of this it was very easy to ask Ian for help and get advice from him. I would definitely take another one of Ian's classes.
