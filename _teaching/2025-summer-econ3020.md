Attention is given to the theory of factor prices and topics on welfare economics.

Overall Quality: 3.86/5

Selected Reviews:
> The instructor was very helpful and responsive to emails. He was flexible and willing to work with students, I really appreciated this. The course was a doozy giving that it is only 3-weeks long but surprisingly manageable.

> The instructor was very flexible when it came to the assignments, understanding that we do have lives outside of this summer class and have other priorities as well. He responds to emails in a timely manner and gets the grading done in a timely manner. I appreciated how the class was set up and that I could do as much or little in a day without getting too far ahead or behind.
