## About Me

Welcome! I am a fourth-year economics PhD student at the University of Wyoming. My research focuses on how behavior adjusts when actions are not attributable to outcomes and preventive policies. I also enjoy topics related to the economics of education and dam management. I primarily use experimental methods to study topics in environmental economics, collective action problems, behavioral economics, and the economics of education.

I received two Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics (B.S.) and Economics (B.S) from the University of Wyoming in May 2022. I also received my Master's degree in Economics (M.S.) from the University of Wyoming in December 2024.

In my free time, I run [Tele-Hope](https://www.tele-hope.org/), a community-building non-profit to end suicide in Wyoming. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, Wicket.

## Papers in Progress

  <summary><strong>Natural Disasters and the Intangibility of Risk Reduction: Experimental Evidence</strong></summary>
  <p>
    The paper investigates how making disaster outcomes more tangible—by revealing whether losses were preventable—affects collective investment in risk mitigation. Using a theoretical model and a 2×2 lab experiment, it shows that when people can attribute outcomes to their own actions, they invest more in prevention after both success and failure, highlighting that causal feedback and observability are key to sustaining preventive behavior.

  <summary><strong>Non-autonomous Management of Jackson Lake Dam Releases in Response to Climate Change</strong></summary>
  <p>
  This paper models the dynamic optimization problem faced by dam managers balancing upstream recreation and downstream flows in a non-autonomous, seasonal environment. Using Jackson Lake as a case study, it compares actual versus optimal management, quantifies the impact of hydrological shocks, and offers a decision-support framework for adapting to future climate and political pressures.

  <summary><strong>Individual Preference Elicitation Transforms ‘Social Carrying Capacity’ into a Pragmatic Management Tool</strong></summary>
  <p>
  People are more tolerant of grizzly encounters than management rules, all, with significant local and regional variation. We use survey data and predictive mapping to document these misalignments between public preferences and federal risk standards.

  <summary><strong>Experiencing carbon pricing</strong></summary>
  <p>
  Experience with Washington’s cap-and-invest program transformed initial opposition to carbon pricing into broader support for the policy. Voter data and survey evidence show that firsthand experience, rather than ideology, drove this shift—boosting approval specifically for the policy voters lived under.

  <summary><strong>From Survival to Learning: The Evolution of Early Childhood Investment Over the Development Cycle</strong></summary>
  <p>
  The paper develops an economic model explaining how countries shift early childhood development investments from health to education as they grow richer and survival improves. Using global data, it finds that nations first focus on survival-related spending, then sharply increase education investment with rising income and health quality—highlighting the importance of sequencing and tailoring ECD policies to development stage rather than adopting uniform strategies.
