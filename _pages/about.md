## About Me

Welcome! I am a fourth-year economics PhD student at the University of Wyoming. My research focuses on how behavior adjusts when actions are not attributable to outcomes and preventive policies. I also enjoy topics related to the economics of education and dam management. I primarily use experimental methods to study topics in environmental economics, collective action problems, behavioral economics, and the economics of education.

I received two Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics (B.S.) and Economics (B.S) from the University of Wyoming in May 2022. I also received my Master's degree in Economics (M.S.) from the University of Wyoming in December 2024.

In my free time, I run [Tele-Hope](https://www.tele-hope.org/), a community-building non-profit to end suicide in Wyoming. I also enjoy spending time with my dog, Wicket.
